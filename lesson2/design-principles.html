            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Johnny's Selected Seeds<br>

                The website for Johnny's Selected Seeds demonstrates visual hierarchy. The large image with a large
                block of text immediately draws the viewer’s eye to the center of the page.<br><br>From there, the
                viewer is pulled toward the red rectangle with the word shop.<br><br>The red at the top of the page
                brings the viewers eye up to the shopping card, the hamburger menu, and finally the free
                shipping.<br><br>At that point, the viewer is pulled back to the center and started all over again. The
                important items are viewed in an easy flowing manner. </p>

            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <p>Perennial Solutions<br>
                <a href="http://www.perennialsolutions.org/">www.perennialsolutions.org</a><br><br>
                <img src="images/PerennialSolutions-tn.jpg" alt="screenshot of home page of Perennial Solutions"><br>
                Eric Toensmeier’s website is clean and simple. White space surrounds the website’s welcome and title
                while acting as a buffer to the two photos. <br><br>
                The hamburger menu appears near the top at the end of a single black bar. The three icons at the bottom
                are surrounded by white which makes it easy to find them. <br><br>
                The large orange font in the middle blends well with the black, white, and green colors found in the
                photos which creates a restful, simple, and unhurried feel.</p>

            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <p>Michaels<br>
                <a href="https://www.michaels.com">www.michaels.com</a><br><br>
                <img src="images/Michaels-tn.jpg" alt="screenshot of home page of Michaels"><br>
                The website for Michaels uses repetition in several ways. The colors red, black, and gray are repeated
                multiple times and immediately stand out. <br><br>
                In addition to the colors, the use of rectangles both in colors and in white space is
                noticeable.<br><br>
                Finally, horizontal lines are used multiple times to separate both content and white space.
